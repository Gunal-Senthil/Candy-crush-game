Candy Crush game developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Candy Crush, a popular match-three puzzle game, can be effectively recreated using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In this version, HTML structures the game's grid, CSS styles the candies and the grid layout, and JavaScript powers the game logic, including creating the grid, handling candy swaps via drag-and-drop, and checking for matches of three or more candies. The game dynamically updates the grid based on user interactions, providing a visual and interactive experience similar to the original game. This project demonstrates the synergy between these technologies to create an engaging and interactive web-based game.
